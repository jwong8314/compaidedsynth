A collection of really interesting papers spurn by the chematica discovery:

------------------

[Predicting the boron orbital structure](
https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2018/sc/c8sc03427c
)

"combined a potential energy sampling method termed stochastic surface walking (SSW) with machine learning to explore the potential energy surface of β-B.1 β-B is believed to be the most stable phase of solid boron, but its atomic structure had remained unclear – until now."

--------------------------------------------

Deep Neural Network Computes Electron Densities
and Energies of a Large Set of Organic Molecules
Faster than Density Functional Theory (DFT) 
[predicting electron density](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02723.pdf)

"Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the main methods in Quantum Chemistry that offers an attractive trade
off between the cost and accuracy of quantum chemical computations. "

--------------------
Controlling an organic synthesis robot with machine learning to search for new reactivity
[Integrated system to explore reactivity; somewhat like an IP system where it can choose the labeled examples](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0307-8.epdf?shared_access_token=XUpzk8aCw7-ORoZFkmtP8dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PkoXk5uIqDml_U7yHIMqOJd1p4gT3dU79JWdc-mLdEQtvHPPCW3TMB6DrUsAde1mdkwmaldc-RVDpMJOFuWmj4s3AjrTv0AUsFopS1vNNSgDXcOtq8D7T0Q9CriV7StYc%3D)

"Here we present an organic synthesis robot that can perform chemical
reactions and analysis faster than they can be performed manually, as
well as predict the reactivity of possible reagent combinations after
conducting a small number of experiments, thus effectively navigating
chemical reaction space."

still have to find this paper

Classic reaction re-engineered through molecular face recognition

[news link](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-04684-2)

haven't found paper
premise is on recognizing and dealing with chirality


----------------
Planning chemical syntheses with deep
neural networks and symbolic AI
[planned synthesis with symbolic AI and DNN](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25978)

" Computer-aided retrosynthesis
would be a valuable tool but at present it is slow and provides results
of unsatisfactory quality."
