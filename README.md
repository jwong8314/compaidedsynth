A collection of really interesting papers spurn by the chematica discovery:

[Predicting the boron orbital structure](

)

"combined a potential energy sampling method termed stochastic surface walking (SSW) with machine learning to explore the potential energy surface of β-B.1 β-B is believed to be the most stable phase of solid boron, but its atomic structure had remained unclear – until now."
